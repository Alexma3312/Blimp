"This file contains the logic required for detecting the pose."

Data coming in:
- use a list with 3 pieces of information: the id (as a string), the coordinates (as a dictionary), the time state
- coordinates of different parts - as a dictionary
- time state

- data is coming in from 2 cameras: use a string "cam1" and "cam2" to serve as their id. 

- this data will be stored by the buffer

- Logic for checking if hand is being pointed at the camera:
--> if hand coordinates == shoulder coordinates --> hand is going up probably
--> if hand coordinates > shoulder coordinates and == head coordinates --> hand is going up progressively
--> for a certain defined number of time states, if the hand coordinates > head coordinates --> means hand is up --> 
At this point, we transmit info about the person's location (using triangulation) to the main module, which transfers that 
information to the blimp's module via the POST method
